# WKP9

Hey team!
After a major graded project, let's do something different, and a little bit more straightforward.
Today weâ€™re going to build a list of the Studio Ghibli Movies, ranked from best to worst. If you havenâ€™t seen any of those, I suggest you to look on the Onja hard drive! (after completing the project of course). They are amazing âœ¨

The website will look similar to this :

![assets/ghibli.png](assets/ghibli.png)

You will fetch the data from this URL [https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films)

and display the result in the HTML. The film needs to be sorted depending on their rt_score!

There is a lot of data in a film object, use whatever attribute you need.

Feel free to add some beautiful styling to your website when you're done fetching and sorting the data.

Good luck ðŸ’»

## WKP9 REPORT
 1) Structure of my project 
  - I have grab the nmain from the html into javaScript.
  -Created  three fuctions
  - Fist fuction is about fecthing the Api or the url so that we can get objects.
  - Second function : created an new variable which makes object easy to grab.And then pass the third fuction into this function.
  - Third fuction : Firstly , I created an html.Secondly I display sort to to get the number of scores from higher into lower , and map throught the object to return an array . Lastly , I insert the html into main which has grabbed before.  
  
2) If had more time
 If I have more time ,  I will try to make my code without error .

3) Did you learn anything new while working on this?
- I have learned new thing such as we need to call function so that it will run.
 
 4) Most challenging part
  - The most chanllenge part is to get the object to appear on the browser.
  - I don't know untill now why is the sort can not read property of undefined.
